# DLL Loading Fix for Sortify

## Issue

When running the Sortify application on some systems, the following error occurs:

```
Failed to execute script 'spacy_hook' due to unhandled exception: 
DLL load failed while importing numpy_ops: The specified module could not be found.
```

This error occurs because PyInstaller is not correctly including all the necessary DLL files required by the spaCy and thinc libraries, particularly the `numpy_ops` module.

## Solution

The following changes have been made to fix this issue:

1. Added `--collect-all` directives to both `build.py` and `build_antivirus.py` to ensure all necessary DLLs are included:
   ```python
   '--collect-all', 'numpy',
   '--collect-all', 'thinc',
   '--collect-all', 'spacy',
   '--collect-all', 'blis',
   '--collect-all', 'cymem',
   '--collect-all', 'preshed',
   ```

2. Enhanced `hook-numpy.py` to:
   - Collect all NumPy DLLs using `collect_dynamic_libs`
   - Add more hidden imports for NumPy modules
   - Add verification code to ensure critical modules can be imported

3. Created new hook files for critical dependencies:
   - `hook-thinc.py`: Ensures all thinc modules and DLLs are included
   - `hook-blis.py`: Ensures all blis modules and DLLs are included
   - `hook-cymem.py`: Ensures all cymem modules and DLLs are included
   - `hook-preshed.py`: Ensures all preshed modules and DLLs are included

## Building the Application

To build the application with these fixes:

1. Run the standard build process:
   ```
   python build.py
   ```

2. Create the installer:
   ```
   build_installer.bat
   ```

3. If Windows Defender issues persist, use the antivirus-friendly build:
   ```
   python build_antivirus.py
   build_installer_safe.bat
   ```

## Verification

After building, verify that the application runs correctly by:

1. Installing the application on a clean system
2. Running the application and checking that it starts without DLL errors
3. Testing the core functionality to ensure everything works as expected

## Additional Notes

If you encounter other DLL loading issues, you may need to:

1. Add more modules to the `--collect-all` directives
2. Create additional hook files for problematic dependencies
3. Use tools like Dependency Walker to identify missing DLLs

The hook files include debug print statements that will show in the console during the build process, helping to identify if modules are being imported correctly.
