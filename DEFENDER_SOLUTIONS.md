# Fixing Windows Defender False Positive Detection

This document provides solutions for the Windows Defender error: "CreateProcess failed; code 225. Operation did not complete successfully because the file contains a virus or potentially unwanted software."

## Immediate Solutions

### Option 1: Add an Exclusion in Windows Defender

1. Open Windows Security (search for it in the Start menu)
2. Click on "Virus & threat protection"
3. Under "Virus & threat protection settings", click "Manage settings"
4. Scroll down to "Exclusions" and click "Add or remove exclusions"
5. Click the "+" button to add an exclusion
6. Select "File" and browse to your Sortify_Setup.exe or the installed Sortify.exe file
7. Click "Open" to add the exclusion

### Option 2: Temporarily Disable Windows Defender Real-time Protection

1. Open Windows Security
2. Click on "Virus & threat protection"
3. Under "Virus & threat protection settings", click "Manage settings"
4. Toggle off "Real-time protection"
5. Install Sortify
6. Re-enable real-time protection after installation

**Note:** This is not recommended as a permanent solution as it leaves your system vulnerable during the installation process.

## Long-term Solutions

### Option 1: Submit the File to Microsoft for Analysis

Submit the Sortify_Setup.exe file to Microsoft for analysis as a false positive:

1. Visit [Microsoft's malware submission portal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/filesubmission)
2. Sign in with a Microsoft account
3. Upload the Sortify_Setup.exe file
4. Select "I believe this file is incorrectly detected as malware"
5. Provide additional information about the application
6. Submit the form

Microsoft typically responds within 24-48 hours. If they confirm it's a false positive, they'll update their definitions, and Windows Defender will no longer flag the file.

### Option 2: Code Signing Certificate

The most professional solution is to sign your application with a trusted code signing certificate:

1. Purchase a code signing certificate from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) like DigiCert, Comodo, or GlobalSign
2. Use the certificate to sign both the PyInstaller-generated executable and the Inno Setup installer
3. The build_installer.bat file has been updated with commented sections for code signing

Steps to implement code signing:

1. Purchase and install a code signing certificate
2. Uncomment and update the signing sections in build_installer.bat with your certificate details
3. Run build_installer.bat to build and sign both the application and installer

### Option 3: Modify PyInstaller Build Options

Some PyInstaller options can help reduce false positives:

1. Always use the `--clean` flag to clean PyInstaller cache before building
2. Try using `--noupx` to disable UPX compression
3. Consider using `--key YOUR_ENCRYPTION_KEY` to use a custom key for bytecode encryption

These options have been incorporated into the build.py file.

## Technical Explanation

PyInstaller-packaged applications are often flagged by antivirus software because:

1. They contain packed/compressed code which is a common characteristic of malware
2. They modify system files during installation
3. They include executable code that's dynamically unpacked at runtime

Code signing helps because it provides verification of the publisher's identity and confirms the code hasn't been tampered with since it was signed.
